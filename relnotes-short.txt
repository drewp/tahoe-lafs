ANNOUNCING v1.6 of Tahoe-LAFS

We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of
version 1.6 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely reliable distributed
data store.

Tahoe-LAFS is the first cloud storage system which offers
"provider-independent security" -- meaning that not even your
cloud service provider can read or alter your data without your
consent.  Here is the one-page explanation of its unique
security and fault-tolerance properties:

Tahoe-LAFS v1.6.0 is the successor to v1.5.0, which was
released August 1, 2009. This release includes major
performance improvements, usability improvements, and one major
new feature: deep-immutable directories (cryptographically
unalterable permanent snapshots). See the release notes for
details.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers have
developed related projects to integrate it with other
tools. These include frontends for Windows, Macintosh,
JavaScript, and iPhone, and plugins for Hadoop, bzr, duplicity,
TiddlyWiki, and more. As of this release, contributors have
added an Android frontend and a working read-only FUSE
frontend. See the Related Projects page on the wiki:

We believe that erasure coding, strong encryption, Free/Open
Source Software and careful engineering make Tahoe-LAFS safer
than other storage technologies.
