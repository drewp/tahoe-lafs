ANNOUNCING the immediate availability of version 1.5 of Tahoe-LAFS.

Tahoe-LAFS is the first cloud storage technology which offers security and
privacy in the sense that the cloud storage service provider itself can't read
or alter your data. Here is the one-page explanation of Tahoe's unique security
and fault-tolerance properties:

This is the successor to v1.4.1, which was released April 13, 2009. This is a
major new release, improving the user interface, increasing performance, and
fixing a few bugs.  See the release notes for details:

In addition to the functionality of Tahoe-LAFS itself, a crop of related
projects have sprung up to extend it and to integrate it into other tools.
These include frontends for Windows, Macintosh, JavaScript, and iPhone, and
plugins for duplicity, bzr, Hadoop, and TiddlyWiki, and more. See the Related
Projects page on the wiki:

Tahoe is the basis of the consumer backup product from Allmydata, Inc. --

We believe that erasure coding, strong encryption, Free/Open Source Software
and good engineering make Tahoe-LAFS safer than other storage technologies.
