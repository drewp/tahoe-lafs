ANNOUNCING v1.6.1 of Tahoe-LAFS

We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of
version 1.6.1 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely reliable distributed
data store.

Tahoe-LAFS is the first cloud storage system which offers
"provider-independent security" -- meaning that not even your
cloud service provider can read or alter your data without your
consent.  Here is the one-page explanation of its unique
security and fault-tolerance properties:

Tahoe-LAFS v1.6.1 is the successor to v1.6.0, which was
released February 2, 2010. This is a bugfix release which
fixes a few small regressions in v1.6.0.

The v1.6 release includes major performance improvements,
usability improvements, and one major new feature:
deep-immutable directories (cryptographically unalterable
permanent snapshots). See the release notes for details.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers have
developed related projects to integrate it with other
tools. These include plugins for Hadoop, bzr, duplicity,
TiddlyWiki, and much more. As of this release, contributors
have added an Android frontend and a working read-only FUSE
frontend. See the Related Projects page on the wiki:

We believe that strong encryption, Free/Open Source Software,
erasure coding, and careful engineering practices make
Tahoe-LAFS safer than other storage technologies.
