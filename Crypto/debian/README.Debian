pycrypto for Debian
-------------------

The debian pythonX.Y-crypto packages contain the Python cryptographic
toolkit compiled for Python X.Y. I have removed the following
algorithms from the upstream source code due to patent/copyright
issues:

  * IDEA - patent issues
  * RC5 - patent issues
  * RIPEMD  - unclarified copyright
