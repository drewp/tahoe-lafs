['*' means complete]

Connection Management: Brian
*v1: foolscap, no relay, live == connected-to-queen, broadcast updates, full mesh
 v2: live != connected-to-queen, connect on demand
 v3: relay?

Encoding: Zooko
*v1: fake it (replication), no merkle trees
 v2: mnet codec, Reed-Solomon?
 v3: merkle tree to verify each share
 v4: merkle tree to verify each segment

Peer selection:
*v1: permuted peer list, consistent hash

filetable maintenance:
*v1: queen-based tree of MutableDirectoryNodes, persisted to queen's disk
     no accounts
 v2: move tree to client side, serialize to a file, upload,
     queen.set_filetable_uri (still no accounts, just one global tree)
 v3: break world up into accounts, separate mutable spaces. Maybe
     implement SSKs

checker/repairer:
*v1: none
 v2: centralized checker, repair agent
 v3: nodes also check their own files

storage: RobK
*v1: no deletion, one directory per verifierid, one owner per share,
     leases never expire
 v2: multiple shares per verifierid [zooko]
 v2: leases expire, delete expired data on demand, multiple owners per share

UI: (brian)
 webish? webfront? PB + CLI tool? FUSE?
*v1: readonly webish (nevow, URLs are filepaths)
*v2: read/write webish
 v3: PB+CLI tool
 v4: FUSE

back pocket ideas:
 when nodes are unable to reach storage servers, make a note of it, inform
 queen eventually. queen then puts server under observation or otherwise
 looks for differences between their self-reported availability and the
 experiences of others

 store filetable URI in the first 10 peers that appear after your own nodeid
 each entry has a sequence number, maybe a timestamp
 on recovery, find the newest

 multiple categories of leases:
  committed leases -- we will not delete these in any case, but will instead tell an uploader that we are full
   active leases
   in-progress leases (partially filled, not closed, pb connection is currently open)
  uncommitted leases -- we will delete these in order to make room for new lease requests
   interrupted leases (partially filled, not closed, pb connection is currently not open, but they might come back)
   expired leases
  (I'm not sure about the precedence of these last two.  Probably deleting expired leases instead of deleting interrupted leases would be okay.)

big questions:
 convergence?
 peer list maintenance: lots of entries
