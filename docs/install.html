This is the default procedure to install from source.  It has been
verified to work on Windows, Cygwin, Mac, Linux, and Solaris.  It's
likely to work on other platforms.  For more details and for
alternative installation procedures, please
see <a href="install-details.html">install-details.html</a>.


DEPENDENCIES:

Prior to installing Tahoe the following must be installed:

1. gcc including g++ (programming language)

   If you are building for Windows or for Cygwin, the Cygwin version
   of gcc will work.

2. GNU make (build tool) 

3. <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> including development
   headers i.e. "Python.h" (programming language)

4. zope.interface (programming language extension)

   Note that Tahoe does <em>not</em> require the entire Zope package,
   merely the much smaller zope.interface component.

5. <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> (network and
   operating system integration library)

   Installing Twisted from the Twisted "sumo" source tarball works on
   all supported platforms.

6. <a href="http://openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>, including development
   headers (cryptography library)

7. <a href="http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net">PyOpenSSL</a> (secure
   transport layer)

8. <a href="http://cryptopp.com">Crypto++</a>, including development
   headers (cryptography library)

9. required only for Windows-native (not required for
   Cygwin): <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">pywin32</a>


GET THE SOURCE CODE:

Tarballs of the source code are available at:

http://allmydata.org/source/tahoe/


INSTALL:

Unpack the tarball and cd into the top-level directory.

Run <pre>make check-deps</pre> which verifies that all of the
dependencies listed above are installed.

Run <pre>make</pre> to build Tahoe and some included libraries and
install the <pre>tahoe</pre> executable into a subdirectory of the
current directory named <pre>bin</pre>.

Run <pre>make test</pre> to verify that it built correctly and passes
all tests.


Now you have the Tahoe source code installed and are ready to use it
to form a decentralized
filesystem. See <a href="running.html">running.html</a> for
instructions.
