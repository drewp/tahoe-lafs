= Configuring a Tahoe node =

A Tahoe node is configured by writing files to its base directory. These
files are read by the node when it starts, so each time you change them, you
need to restart the node.

The node also writes state to its base directory, so it will create files on
its own.

This document contains a complete list of the config files that are examined
by the client node, as well as the state files that you'll observe in its
base directory.

== Client Configuration ==

introducer.furl (mandatory): This FURL tells the client how to connect to the
introducer. Each Tahoe grid is defined by an introducer. The introducer's
furl is created by the introducer node and written into its base directory
when it starts, whereupon it should be published to everyone who wishes to
attach a client to that grid

webport (optional): This controls where the client's webserver should
listen, providing filesystem access as defined in webapi.txt . This
file contains a Twisted "strports" specification XXX hyperlink,
such as "8123" or "tcp:8123:interface=127.0.0.1".  The 'tahoe
create-client' command sets the webport to
"tcp:8123:interface=127.0.0.1" by default, and is overridable by the
"--webport" option.

XXX <pre>tahoe create-client</pre> will put a port specification into a file named
XXX $HERE/webport, unless overridden by the --webport option to
XXX create-client.  The presence of a port specification in the webport
XXX file prompts the client node to run a webserver on the desired port,
XXX through which you can view, upload, download, and delete files.  The
XXX contents of the webport file is actually a "strports specification",
XXX defined in
XXX http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.application.strports.html
XXX , so you can have it only listen on a local interface by writing
XXX "tcp:8123:interface=127.0.0.1" to this file (that's what create-client
XXX does by default), or make it use SSL by writing
XXX "ssl:8123:privateKey=mykey.pem:certKey=cert.pem" instead.


client.port (optional): This controls which port the node listens on. If not
provided, the node will ask the kernel for any available port, and write it
to this file so that subsequent runs will re-use the same port.

advertised_ip_addresses (optional): The node normally uses tools like
'ifconfig' to determine the set of IP addresses on which it can be reached
from nodes both near and far. The node introduces itself to the rest of the
grid with a FURL that contains a series of (ipaddr, port) pairs which other
nodes will use to contact this one. By providing this file, you can add to
this list. This can be useful if your node is running behind a firewall, but
you have created a port-forwarding to allow the outside world to access it.
Each line must have a dotted-quad IP address and an optional :portnum
specification:

 123.45.67.89
 44.55.66.77:8098

Lines that do not provide a port number will use the same client.port as the
automatically-discovered addresses.

authorized_keys.SSHPORT (optional): This enables an SSH-based interactive
Python shell, which can be used to inspect the internal state of the node,
for debugging.  To cause the node to accept SSH connections on port 8022,
symlink "authorized_keys.8022" to your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, and it
will accept the same keys as the rest of your account.

sizelimit (optional): If present, this file establishes an upper bound (in
bytes) on the amount of storage consumed by share data (data that your node
holds on behalf of clients that are uploading files to the grid). To avoid
providing more than 100MB of data to other clients, write "100000000" into
this file. Note that this is a fairly loose bound, and the node may
occasionally use slightly more storage than this. To enforce a stronger (and
possibly more reliable) limit, use a symlink to place the 'storage/'
directory on a separate size-limited filesystem, and/or use per-user
OS/filesystem quotas.

root_dir.cap (optional): The command-line tools will read a directory cap out of
this file and use it, if you don't specify a '--dir-uri' option or if you
specify '--dir-uri=root'.


== Node State ==

node.pem : This contains an SSL private-key certificate. The node generates
this the first time it is started, and re-uses it on subsequent runs. This
certificate allows the node to have a cryptographically-strong identifier
(the Foolscap "TubID"), and to establish secure connections to other nodes.

storage/ : Nodes which host StorageServers will create this directory to hold
shares of files on behalf of other clients. There will be a directory
underneath it for each StorageIndex for which this node is holding shares.
There is also an "incoming" directory where partially-completed shares are
held while they are being received.

client.tac : this file defines the client, by constructing the actual Client
instance each time the node is started. It is used by the 'twistd'
daemonization program (in the "-y" mode), which is run internally by the
"tahoe start" command. This file is created by the "tahoe create-client"
command.

control.furl : this file contains a FURL that provides access to a control
port on the client node, from which files can be uploaded and downloaded.
This file is created with permissions that prevent anyone else from reading
it (on operating systems that support such a concept), to insure that only
the owner of the client node can use this feature.  This port is intended for
debugging and testing use.

logport.furl : this file contains a FURL that provides access to a 'log port'
on the client node, from which operational logs can be retrieved. Do not
grant logport access to strangers, because occasionally secret information
may be placed in the logs.

log_gatherer.furl : if present, this file is used to contact a 'log
gatherer', which will be granted access to the logport. This can be used by
centralized storage meshes to gather operational logs in a single place.


== Introducer configuration ==

Introducer nodes use the same 'advertised_ip_addresses' file as client
nodes. They also use 'authorized_keys.SSHPORT'.

encoding_parameters (optional): This file sets the encoding parameters that
will be distributed to all client nodes and used when they encode files
(unless locally overridden). It should contain three numbers, separated by
whitespace, called "needed", "desired", and "total".

 "needed": this is the number of shares that will be needed to reconstruct
           the file. Each share that is pushed to a StorageServer will be
           the size of the original file divided by this number.
 "desired": the encoding/upload process will be happy if it can push
            this many shares to StorageServers. If it cannot, it will
            report failure.
 "total": this is the total number of shares that will be produced. The
          expansion factor (i.e. the amount of space consumed on the whole
          grid divided by the size of the file) will be total/needed. It does
          not make a lot of sense to have "total" be much larger than the
          maximum number of storage nodes you expect to ever have.

The default value of encoding_parameters is "3 7 10".


== Introducer state ==

The Introducer node maintains some different state than regular client
nodes.

introducer.furl : This is generated the first time the introducer node is
started, and used again on subsequent runs, to give the introduction service
a persistent long-term identity. This file should be published and copied
into new client nodes before they are started for the first time.

introducer.port : this serves exactly the same purpose as 'client.port', but
has a different name to make it clear what kind of node is being run.

introducer.tac : this file is like client.tac but defines an
introducer node instead of a client node.

== Other files ==

logs/ : Each Tahoe node creates a directory to hold the log messages produced
as the node runs. These logfiles are created and rotated by the "twistd"
daemonization program, so logs/twistd.log will contain the most recent
messages, logs/twistd.log.1 will contain the previous ones, logs/twistd.log.2
will be older still, and so on. twistd rotates logfiles after they grow
beyond 1MB in size. If the space consumed by logfiles becomes troublesome,
they should be pruned: a cron job to delete all files that were created more
than a month ago in this logs/ directory should be sufficient.

my_nodeid : this is written by all nodes after startup, and contains a
base32-encoded (i.e. human-readable) NodeID that identifies this specific
node. This NodeID is the same string that gets displayed on the web page (in
the "which peers am I connected to" list), and the shortened form (the first
characters) is recorded in various log messages.
