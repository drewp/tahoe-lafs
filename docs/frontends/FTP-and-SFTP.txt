== FTP/SFTP Background ==

FTP is the venerable internet file-transfer protocol, first developed in
1971. The FTP server usually listens on port 21. A separate connection is
used for the actual data transfers, either in the same direction as the
initial client-to-server connection (for PORT mode), or in the reverse
direction (for PASV) mode. Connections are unencrypted, so passwords, file
names, and file contents are visible to eavesdroppers.

SFTP is the modern replacement, developed as part of the SSH "secure shell"
protocol, and runs as a subchannel of the regular SSH connection. The SSH
server usually listens on port 22. All connections are encrypted.

Both FTP and SFTP were developed assuming a UNIX-like server, with accounts
and passwords, octal file modes (user/group/other, read/write/execute), and
ctime/mtime timestamps.


== Tahoe Support ==

All Tahoe client nodes can run a frontend FTP server, allowing regular FTP
clients (like /usr/bin/ftp, ncftp, and countless others) to access the
virtual filesystem. They can also run an SFTP server, so SFTP clients (like
/usr/bin/sftp, the sshfs FUSE plugin, and others) can too. These frontends
sit at the same level as the webapi interface.

Since Tahoe does not use user accounts or passwords, the FTP/SFTP servers
must be configured with a way to first authenticate a user (confirm that a
prospective client has a legitimate claim to whatever authorities we might
grant a particular user), and second to decide what root directory cap should
be granted to the authenticated username. FTP uses a username and password
for this purpose. SFTP can either use a username and password, or a username
and an RSA or DSA public key (SSH servers are frequently configured to
require public key logins and reject passwords, to remove the threat of
password-guessing attacks, at the expense of requiring users to carry their
private keys around with them).

Tahoe provides two mechanisms to perform this user-to-rootcap mapping. The
first is a simple flat file with one account per line. The second is an
HTTP-based login mechanism, backed by simple PHP script and a database. The
latter form is used by allmydata.com to provide secure access to customer
rootcaps.


== Creating an Account File ==

To use the first form, create a file (probably in
BASEDIR/private/ftp.accounts) in which each non-comment/non-blank line is a
space-separated line of (USERNAME, PASSWORD/PUBKEY, ROOTCAP), like so:

 % cat BASEDIR/private/ftp.accounts
 # This is a password line, (username, password, rootcap)
 alice password URI:DIR2:ioej8xmzrwilg772gzj4fhdg7a:wtiizszzz2rgmczv4wl6bqvbv33ag4kvbr6prz3u6w3geixa6m6a
 bob sekrit URI:DIR2:6bdmeitystckbl9yqlw7g56f4e:serp5ioqxnh34mlbmzwvkp3odehsyrr7eytt5f64we3k9hhcrcja

 # and this is a public key line (username, pubkey, rootcap)
 carol ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAv2xHRVBoXnwxHLzthRD1wOWtyZ08b8n9cMZfJ58CBdBwAYP2NVNXc0XjRvswm5hnnAO+jyWPVNpXJjm9XllzYhODSNtSN+TXuJlUjhzA/T+ZwdgsgSAeHuuMQBoWt4Qc9HV6rHCdAeMhcnyqm6Q0sRAsfA/wfwiIgbvE7+cWpFa2anB6WeAnvK8+dMN0nvnkPE7GNyf/WFR1Ffuh9ifKdRB6yDNp17bQAqA3OWSFjch6fGPhp94y4g2jmTHlEUTyVsilgGqvGOutOVYnmOMnFijugU1Vu33G39GGzXWla6+fXwTk/oiVPiCYD7A7WFKes3nqMg8iVN6a6sxujrhnHQ== warner@fluxx URI:DIR2:6bdmeitystckbl9yqlw7g56f4e:serp5ioqxnh34mlbmzwvkp3odehsyrr7eytt5f64we3k9hhcrcja

[TODO: the PUBKEY form is not yet supported]

Note that if the second word of the line is "ssh-rsa" or "ssh-dss", the rest
of the line is parsed differently, so users cannot have a password equal to
either of these strings.

Then add an 'accounts.file' directive to your tahoe.cfg file, as described
in the next sections.


== Configuring FTP Access ==

To enable the FTP server with an accounts file, add the following lines to
the BASEDIR/tahoe.cfg file:

 [ftpd]
 enabled = true
 port = 8021
 accounts.file = private/ftp.accounts

The FTP server will listen on the given port number. The "accounts.file"
pathname will be interpreted relative to the node's BASEDIR.

To enable the FTP server with an account server instead, provide the URL of
that server in an "accounts.url" directive:

 [ftpd]
 enabled = true
 port = 8021
 accounts.url = https://example.com/login

You can provide both accounts.file and accounts.url, although it probably
isn't very useful except for testing.


== Configuring SFTP Access ==

The Tahoe SFTP server requires a host keypair, just like the regular SSH
server. It is important to give each server a distinct keypair, to prevent
one server from masquerading as different one. The first time a client
program talks to a given server, it will store the host key it receives, and
will complain if a subsequent connection uses a different key. This reduces
the opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks to just the first connection.

You will use directives in the tahoe.cfg file to tell the SFTP code where to
find these keys. To create one, use the ssh-keygen tool (which comes with the
standard openssh client distribution):

% cd BASEDIR
% ssh-keygen -f private/ssh_host_rsa_key

Then, to enable the SFTP server with an accounts file, add the following
lines to the BASEDIR/tahoe.cfg file:

 [sftpd]
 enabled = true
 port = 8022
 host_pubkey_file = private/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
 host_privkey_file = private/ssh_host_rsa_key
 accounts.file = private/ftp.accounts

The SFTP server will listen on the given port number. The "accounts.file"
pathname will be interpreted relative to the node's BASEDIR.

Or, to use an account server instead, do this:

 [sftpd]
 enabled = true
 port = 8022
 host_pubkey_file = private/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
 host_privkey_file = private/ssh_host_rsa_key
 accounts.url = https://example.com/login

You can provide both accounts.file and accounts.url, although it probably
isn't very useful except for testing.

clients and with the sshfs filesystem, see

== Dependencies ==

The Tahoe SFTP server requires the Twisted "Conch" component (a "conch" is a
twisted shell, get it?). Many Linux distributions package the Conch code
separately: debian puts it in the "python-twisted-conch" package. Conch
requires the "pycrypto" package, which is a Python+C implementation of many
cryptographic functions (the debian package is named "python-crypto").

Note that "pycrypto" is different than the "pycryptopp" package that Tahoe
uses (which is a Python wrapper around the C++ -based Crypto++ library, a
library that is frequently installed as /usr/lib/libcryptopp.a, to avoid
problems with non-alphanumerics in filenames).

The FTP server requires code in Twisted that enables asynchronous closing of
file-upload operations. This code was landed to Twisted's SVN trunk in r28453
on 23-Feb-2010, slightly too late for the Twisted-10.0 release, but it should
be present in the next release after that. To use Tahoe's FTP server with
Twisted-10.0 or earlier, you will need to apply the patch attached to
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3462 . The Tahoe node will refuse to
start the FTP server unless it detects the necessary support code in Twisted.
This patch is not needed for SFTP.


== Immutable and mutable files ==

All files created via SFTP (and FTP) are immutable files. However, files
can only be created in writeable directories, which allows the directory
entry to be relinked to a different file. Normally, when the path of an
immutable file is opened for writing by SFTP, the directory entry is
relinked to another file with the newly written contents when the file
handle is closed. The old file is still present on the grid, and any other
caps to it will remain valid. (See docs/garbage-collection.txt for how to
reclaim the space used by files that are no longer needed.)

The 'no-write' metadata field of a directory entry can override this
behaviour. If the 'no-write' field holds a non-empty string (typically
"true"), then a permission error will occur when trying to write to the
file, even if it is in a writeable directory. This does not prevent the
directory entry from being unlinked or replaced.

When using sshfs, the 'no-write' field can be set by clearing the 'w'
bits in the Unix permissions, for example using the command
'chmod 444 path/to/file'. Note that this does not mean that arbitrary
combinations of Unix permissions are supported. If the 'w' bits are
cleared on a link to a mutable file or directory, that link will become
read-only.

If SFTP is used to write to an existing mutable file, it will publish a
new version when the file handle is closed.

Mutable files are not supported by the FTP frontend.
