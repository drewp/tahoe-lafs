    <h1>Write Collisions</h1>
    <p>Tahoe does not provide locking of the mutable files and directories.  If there is more than one simultaneous attempt to change a mutable file or directory, then an <cite>UncoordinatedWriteError</p> will result.  This might, in rare cases, cause the file or directory contents to be accidentally deleted.  The user is expected to ensure that there is at most one outstanding write or update request for a given file or directory at a time.  One convenient way to accomplish this is to make a different file or directory for each person or process which wants to write.</p>
