This is how to run a Tahoe node or a complete Tahoe grid.  First you
have to install the Tahoe source code, as documented
in <a href="install.html">install.html</a>.


RUNNING:

The <pre>tahoe</pre> executable is used to create, start, and stop
nodes.  Each node lives in a separate base directory, inside of which
you can add files to configure the node.  Nodes also read and write
files within that directory.

A grid consists of a single Introducer and one or more nodes.  If you
are creating a new grid, you'll need to create both an Introducer and
a node (and then invite other people to create their own nodes and
join your grid).  If you are joining an existing grid (such
as <a href="http://XXX">the public test grid</a>), the Introducer will
already be running, and you'll need to create a node.

To construct an introducer, create a new empty base directory for it
(the name of the directory is up to you) and cd into that directory.
Now run <pre>tahoe create-introducer</pre>.  Now start the introducer
by running <pre>tahoe start</pre>.  After it starts, there will be a
file named <pre>introducer.furl</pre> in that base directory.  This
file contains the URL which the nodes must use in order to connect to
this introducer.

To construct a node, create a new empty base directory (the name of
the directory is up to you) and cd into that directory.  Now
run <pre>tahoe create-client</pre>.  Acquire a copy of
the <pre>introducer.furl</pre> from the introducer and put it into
this directory, then run <pre>tahoe start</pre>.  After that, the node
should be off and running.  The first thing it will do is connect to
the introducer and get itself connected to all other nodes on the
grid.
