    <h1>How To Start Tahoe</h1>

    <p>This is how to run a Tahoe node or a complete Tahoe grid. First you
    have to install the Tahoe source code, as documented in <a
    href="install.html">install.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The <cite>tahoe</cite> executable is used to create, start, and stop
    nodes. Each node lives in a separate base directory in which you can add
    files to configure the node. Nodes also read and write files within that
    directory.</p>

    <p>A grid consists of a single Introducer and one or more nodes. If you
    are creating a new grid, you'll need to create both an Introducer and a
    node (and then invite other people to create their own nodes and join
    your grid). If you are joining an existing grid (such as <a
    href="http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/wiki/TestGrid">the public test
    grid</a>), the Introducer will already be running, and you'll need to
    create a node.</p>

    <p>To construct an introducer, create a new base directory for it (the name
    of the directory is up to you), cd into it, and run "<cite>tahoe
    create-introducer .</cite>". Now start the introducer by running "<cite>tahoe
    start .</cite>". After it starts, there will be a file named
    <cite>introducer.furl</cite> in that base directory. This file contains
    the URL the nodes must use in order to connect to this
    introducer.</p>

    <p>To construct a node run "<cite>tahoe create-client</cite>", which will
    create <cite>~/.tahoe</cite> to be the node's base directory. Acquire a copy
    of the <cite>introducer.furl</cite> from the introducer and put it into this
    directory, then run "<cite>tahoe start</cite>". After that, the node should
    be off and running. The first thing it will do is connect to the introducer
    and get itself connected to all other nodes on the grid.  By default, a node
    serves as both a Storage Server (meaning that it offers some of its disk
    space to other nodes) and as a Gateway (meaning that it listens for HTTP
    requests on port 8123).  To configure other behavior,
    see <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a>.</p>

    <p>To stop a running node run "<cite>tahoe stop</cite>".</p>

    <h2>Do Stuff With It</h2>

    <p>Now you have a decentralized filesystem.  See <a href="using.html">using.html</a> for instructions about how to interact with it.</p>
