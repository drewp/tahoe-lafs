    <h1>How To Start Tahoe-LAFS</h1>

    <p>This is how to run a Tahoe-LAFS client or a complete Tahoe-LAFS grid. First you
    have to install the Tahoe-LAFS software, as documented in <a
    href="install.html">install.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The <code>tahoe</code> program in the <code>bin</code> directory is
    used to create, start, and stop nodes. Each node lives in a separate base
    directory, in which there is a configuration file named <code>tahoe.cfg</code>. Nodes
    read and write files within this base directory.</p>

    <p>A grid consists of a set of <em>storage nodes</em> and <em>client nodes</em>
    running the Tahoe-LAFS code. There is also an <em>introducer node</em> that
    is responsible for getting the other nodes talking to each other.</p>

    <p>If you're getting started we recommend you try connecting to
    the <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/wiki/TestGrid">the
    public test grid</a> as you only need to create a client node.
    When you want to create your own grid you'll need to create the
    introducer and several initial storage nodes (see the note about
    small grids below).</p>

    <p>To construct a client node, run
    "<code><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    create-client</code>", which will create <code>~/.tahoe</code> to be the
    node's base directory. Acquire a copy of the <code>introducer.furl</code>
    from the introducer and put it into this directory, then use
    "<code><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    run</code>". After that, the node should be off and running. The first
    thing it will do is connect to the introducer and get itself connected to
    all other nodes on the grid.  By default, a node will serve as a storage
    node, meaning that it offers its disk space to other nodes.  To configure
    other behavior, see <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a>.</p>


    <p>To construct an introducer, create a new base directory for it (the name
    of the directory is up to you), <code>cd</code> into it, and run
    "<code><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    create-introducer .</code>". Now run the introducer using
    "<code>tahoe start .</code>". After it starts, it will write a file named
    <code>introducer.furl</code> in that base directory. This file contains the
    URL the other nodes must use in order to connect to this introducer.</p>


    <p>The "<code>tahoe run</code>" command above
    will run the node in the foreground. On Unix, you can run it in the background
    instead by using the "<code>tahoe start</code>" command.
    To stop a node started in this way, use "<code>tahoe stop</code>".
    <code>tahoe --help</code> gives a summary of all commands.</p>


    <p>See <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a> for more
    details about how to configure Tahoe-LAFS, including how to get other
    clients to connect to your node if it is behind a firewall or NAT device.


    <h2>A note about small grids</h2>

    <p>By default, Tahoe-LAFS ships with the configuration parameter
    <code>shares.happy</code> set to 7. If you are using Tahoe-LAFS on a
    grid with fewer than 7 storage nodes, this won't work well for you
    &mdash; none of your uploads will succeed. To fix this, see <a
    href='configuration.txt'>configuration.txt</a> to learn how to set
    <code>shares.happy</code> to a more suitable value for your
    grid.</p>

    <h2>Do Stuff With It</h2>

    <p>Now you have a decentralized filesystem.  See <a
    href="using.html">using.html</a> for instructions about how to interact
    with it.</p>
