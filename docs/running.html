    <h1>How To Start Tahoe</h1>

    <p>This is how to run a Tahoe client or a complete Tahoe grid. First you
    have to install the Tahoe software, as documented in <a
    href="install.html">install.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The <cite>tahoe</cite> executable in the <cite>bin</cite> directory is
    used to create, start, and stop nodes. Each node lives in a separate base
    directory, in which there is a configuration file named "tahoe.cfg". Nodes
    read and write files within that directory.</p>

    <p>A grid consists of a single introducer, one or more servers, and any
    number of clients. If you are creating a new grid, you'll need to create
    both an introducer and a server (and then invite other people to create
    their own servers and/or clients and join your grid). If you are joining an
    existing grid (such as <a
    href="http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/wiki/TestGrid">the public test
    grid</a>), the introducer will already be running, and you'll just need to
    create a client.</p>

    <p>To construct an introducer, create a new base directory for it (the name
    of the directory is up to you), cd into it, and run
    "<cite><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    create-introducer .</cite>". Now start the introducer by running
    "<cite>tahoe start .</cite>". After it starts, it will write a file named
    <cite>introducer.furl</cite> in that base directory. This file contains the
    URL the other nodes must use in order to connect to this introducer.</p>

    <p>To construct a node, run
    "<cite><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    create-client</cite>", which will create <cite>~/.tahoe</cite> to be the
    node's base directory. Acquire a copy of the <cite>introducer.furl</cite>
    from the introducer and put it into this directory, then run
    "<cite><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    start</cite>". After that, the node should be off and running. The first
    thing it will do is connect to the introducer and get itself connected to
    all other nodes on the grid.  By default, a node will serve as a Storage
    Server, meaning that it offers its disk space to other nodes.  To configure
    other behavior, see <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are behind firewall or NAT and want to run a server which clients
    can connect to even though they are also behind firewall or NAT, then see
    <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a> about the
    <cite>tub.location</cite> setting.</p>

    <p>To stop a running node run
    "<cite><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    stop</cite>".</p>

    <h2>Do Stuff With It</h2>

    <p>Now you have a decentralized filesystem.  See <a
    href="using.html">using.html</a> for instructions about how to interact
    with it.</p>
