    <h1>How To Start Tahoe-LAFS</h1>

    <p>This is how to run a Tahoe client or a complete Tahoe grid. First you
    have to install the Tahoe software, as documented in <a
    href="install.html">install.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The <cite>tahoe</cite> executable in the <code>bin</code> directory is
    used to create, start, and stop nodes. Each node lives in a separate base
    directory, in which there is a configuration file named <code>tahoe.cfg</code>. Nodes
    read and write files within this base directory.</p>

    <p>A grid consists of a set of <em>nodes</em>, computers running
    the tahoe code, each of these nodes functions as in one of the
    following roles:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Storage Nodes (or Server Nodes)</dt><dd>are the computers
      that actually store the data in a grid.</dd>
      <dt>Client Nodes</dt><dd>talk to the storage nodes to put files
      onto the grid and get them back off again.</dd>
      <dt>Introducer Node</dt><dd>is responsible for getting everybody
      talking to each other.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If you're getting started we recommend you try connecting to
    the <a href="http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/wiki/TestGrid">the
    public test grid</a> as you only need to create a client node.
    When you want to create your own grid you'll need to create the
    introducer and an initial storage nodes.</p>

    <p>To construct a client node, run
    "<code><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    create-client</code>", which will create <code>~/.tahoe</code> to be the
    node's base directory. Acquire a copy of the <code>introducer.furl</code>
    from the introducer and put it into this directory, then use
    "<code><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    run</code>". After that, the node should be off and running. The first
    thing it will do is connect to the introducer and get itself connected to
    all other nodes on the grid.  By default, a node will serve as a storage
    node, meaning that it offers its disk space to other nodes.  To configure
    other behavior, see <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a>.</p>


    <p>To construct an introducer, create a new base directory for it (the name
    of the directory is up to you), cd into it, and run
    "<code><strong>path-to-the-tahoe-bin-directory</strong>/tahoe
    create-introducer .</code>". Now run the introducer using
    "<code>tahoe start .</code>". After it starts, it will write a file named
    <code>introducer.furl</code> in that base directory. This file contains the
    URL the other nodes must use in order to connect to this introducer.</p>


    <p>The "<code>tahoe run</code>" command above
    will run the node in the foreground. On Unix, you can run it in the background
    instead by using the "<code>tahoe start</code>" command.
    To stop a node started in this way, use "<code>tahoe stop</code>".
    <code>tahoe --help</code> gives a summary of all commands.</p>


    <p>See <a href="configuration.txt">configuration.txt</a> for more
    details about how to configure tahoe.</p>


    <h2>A note about firewalls</h2>

    <p>If your node is behind a firewall or NAT device and want other
    clients to connect to it then you'll need to <em>open a port</em>
    in your firewall.  To do that you'll need to know which port tahoe
    is listening on as, by default, it listens on an arbitrary port
    number.  To tell tahoe to listen to a fixed port, open the
    <code>~/.tahoe/tahoe.cfg</code> file in your favourite text editor
    and changing the <code>tub.port</code> line to something like the
    following:</p>

    <pre>tub.port = 8098</pre>

    <p>This tells tahoe to always listen on port 8098 of your
    computer.  The next issue is that your computer may be behind a
    NATing router and isn't directly connected to the internet but
    goes through a router to get out.  If that's the case then you'll
    need to set the <code>tub.location</code> option so that tahoe
    tells the introducer where you're really listening:</p>

    <pre>tub.location = myserver.mydomain.org:8098</pre>

    <p>or probably more likely</p>

    <pre>tub.location = 123.456.789.012:8098</pre>

    <h2>Do Stuff With It</h2>

    <p>Now you have a decentralized filesystem.  See <a
    href="using.html">using.html</a> for instructions about how to interact
    with it.</p>
