    <h1>How To Run Tahoe</h1>

    <p>This is how to run a Tahoe node or a complete Tahoe grid. First you
    have to install the Tahoe source code, as documented in <a
    href="install.html">install.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The <cite>tahoe</cite> executable is used to create, start, and stop
    nodes. Each node lives in a separate base directory, inside of which you
    can add files to configure the node. Nodes also read and write files
    within that directory.</p>

    <p>A grid consists of a single Introducer and one or more nodes. If you
    are creating a new grid, you'll need to create both an Introducer and a
    node (and then invite other people to create their own nodes and join
    your grid). If you are joining an existing grid (such as <a
    href="http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/wiki/TestGrid">the public test
    grid</a>), the Introducer will already be running, and you'll need to
    create a node.</p>

    <p>To construct an introducer, choose a new base directory for it (the
    name of the directory is up to you). We'll call this directory $INTRODIR.
    Now run <cite>tahoe create-introducer $INTRODIR</cite>, which will create
    the directory for you. Now start the introducer by running <cite>tahoe
    start $INTRODIR</cite>. After it starts, there will be a file named
    <cite>introducer.furl</cite> in that base directory. This file contains
    the URL which the nodes must use in order to connect to this
    introducer.</p>

    <p>To construct a node, choose a new empty base directory (again, the
    name of the directory is up to you), which we'll call $NODEDIR. Now run
    <cite>tahoe create-client $NODEDIR</cite>, which will create the
    directory. Acquire a copy of the <cite>introducer.furl</cite> from the
    introducer and put it into this directory, then run <cite>tahoe start
    $NODEDIR</cite>. After that, the node should be off and running. The
    first thing it will do is connect to the introducer and get itself
    connected to all other nodes on the grid.</p>

    <p>If you're only running a single node, the usual base directory for it
    is ~/.tahoe . The <cite>tahoe</cite> executable will use this as a
    default if you don't provide a $NODEDIR explicitly. So an easy way to set
    up your node is to run <cite>tahoe create-client</cite>, copy in the
    <cite>introducer.furl</cite>, then run <cite>tahoe start</cite>.</p>

    <p>Point your web browser to <a
    href="http://127.0.0.1:8123">http://127.0.0.1:8123</a> to use this
    node.</p>
