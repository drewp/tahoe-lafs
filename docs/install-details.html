revision control tool by running the following command:

<pre>
darcs get http://allmydata.org/source/tahoe/trunk tahoe

This will create a directory named <pre>tahoe</pre> in the current working
directory and put a copy of the latest source code into it.  Later, if
you want to get any new changes, then cd into that directory and run
the command <pre>darcs pull</pre>.

EASY_INSTALLABLE DEPENDENCIES

The following Python packages are required, but normally they are
automatically installed as a side-effect of installing Tahoe.

 + Python setuptools (build and distribution tool)

   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions

   The Tahoe install process will automatically download and install
   setuptools if it is not present.  However, if an old, incompatible version
   of setuptools is present (< v0.6c6 on Cygwin, or < v0.6a9 on other
   platforms), then the install will fail.

   If the install fails due to your current version of setuptools being
   incompatible, please either upgrade or uninstall your version of
   setuptools and re-run the install.

 + zfec (erasure coding library)

   http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zfec

   zfec is packaged in a setuptools-compatible way and included in the Python
   Package Index (PyPI), so it will be automatically installed when you
   install Tahoe (see INSTALLING).  It can be manually installed by running
   "easy_install zfec".

 + Python foolscap (secure remote object library)

   http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/foolscap

   foolscape is packaged in a setuptools-compatible way and included in the
   Python Package Index (PyPI), so it will be automatically installed when
   you install Tahoe (see INSTALLING).  It can be manually installed by
   running "easy_install foolscap".

 + Python simplejson (JSON parser)

   http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson

   simplejson is packaged in a setuptools-compatible way and included in the
   Python Package Index (PyPI), so it will be automatically installed when
   you install Tahoe (see INSTALLING).  It can be manually installed by
   running "easy_install simplejson".

 + Python Nevow (0.6.0 or later) (web presentation language)

   http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow

   Note that the current version of Nevow (0.9.18) requires Twisted 2.4.0 or
   later.

   Nevow is packaged in a setuptools-compatible way and included in the
   Python Package Index (PyPI), so it will be automatically installed when
   you install Tahoe (see INSTALLING).  It can be manually installed by
   running "easy_install nevow".

 + Python pycryptopp (0.2.1 or later) (Python crypto library)

   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycryptopp

   pycryptopp is packaged in a setuptools-compatible way and included in the
   Python Package Index (PyPI), so it will be automatically installed when
   you install Tahoe (see INSTALLING).  It can be manually installed by
   running "easy_install nevow".

If you are behind a firewall and you can configure your firewall to
forward TCP connections on a port to the computer running your Tahoe
node, then you can configure the Tahoe node to announce itself as
being available on that IP address and port.  The way to do this is to
create a file named $HERE/advertised_ip_addresses, in which you can
put IP addresses and port numbers in "dotted-quad:port" form,
e.g. "209.97.232.113:1345".  You can put multiple
IP-address-and-port-number entries into this file, on separate lines.
