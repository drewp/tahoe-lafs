"""
Create src/allmydata/version.py, based upon the latest darcs release tag.

If your source tree is coming from darcs (i.e. there exists a _darcs
directory), this tool will determine the most recent release tag, count the
patches that have been applied since then, and compute a version number to be
written into version.py . This version number will be available by doing:

 from allmydata import __version__

Source trees that do not come from darcs (release tarballs, nightly tarballs)
do not have a _darcs directory. Instead, they should have a version.py that
was generated before the tarball was produced. In this case, this script will
quietly exit without modifying the existing version.py .

FYI, src/allmydata/__init__.py will attempt to import version.py and use the
version number therein. If it cannot, it will announce a version of
'UNKNOWN'. This should only happen if someone manages to get hold of a
non-_darcs/ source tree.

'release tags' are tags in the tahoe source tree that match the following
regexp:

 ^allmydata-tahoe-\d+\.\d+\.\d+\w*$

This excludes zfec tags (which start with 'zfec '). It also excludes
'developer convenience tags', which look like 'hoping to fix bug -warner'.
(the original goal was to use release tags that lacked the 'allmydata-tahoe-'
prefix, but it turns out to be more efficient to keep it in, because I can't
get 'darcs changes --from-tag=' to accept real regexps).
