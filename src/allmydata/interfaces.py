        This method is, um, large. The goal is to allow clients to update all
        the shares associated with a mutable file in a single round trip.

        @param storage_index: the index of the bucket to be created or
                              increfed.

                              should be used for each slot*server pair.
        @param renew_secret: This is the secret used to protect bucket refresh
                             This secret is generated by the client and
                             stored for later comparison by the server. Each
                             server is given a different secret.
        @param cancel_secret: Like renew_secret, but protects bucket decref.

        The 'secrets' argument is a tuple of (write_enabler, renew_secret,
        cancel_secret). The first is required to perform any write. The
        latter two are used when allocating new shares. To simply acquire a
        new lease on existing shares, use an empty testv and an empty writev.

        Each share can have a separate test vector (i.e. a list of
        comparisons to perform). If all vectors for all shares pass, then all
        writes for all shares are recorded. Each comparison is a 4-tuple of
        (offset, length, operator, specimen), which effectively does a bool(
        (read(offset, length)) OPERATOR specimen ) and only performs the
        write if all these evaluate to True. Basic test-and-set uses 'eq'.
        Write-if-newer uses a seqnum and (offset, length, 'lt', specimen).
        Write-if-same-or-newer uses 'le'.

        Reads from the end of the container are truncated, and missing shares
        behave like empty ones, so to assert that a share doesn't exist (for
        use when creating a new share), use (0, 1, 'eq', '').

        The write vector will be applied to the given share, expanding it if
        necessary. A write vector applied to a share number that did not
        exist previously will cause that share to be created.

        Each write vector is accompanied by a 'new_length' argument. If
        new_length is not None, use it to set the size of the container. This
        can be used to pre-allocate space for a series of upcoming writes, or
        truncate existing data. If the container is growing, new_length will
        be applied before datav. If the container is shrinking, it will be
        applied afterwards.

        The read vector is used to extract data from all known shares,
        *before* any writes have been applied. The same vector is used for
        all shares. This captures the state that was tested by the test
        vector.

        This method returns two values: a boolean and a dict. The boolean is
        True if the write vectors were applied, False if not. The dict is
        keyed by share number, and each value contains a list of strings, one
        for each element of the read vector.

        If the write_enabler is wrong, this will raise BadWriteEnablerError.
        To enable share migration (using update_write_enabler), the exception
        will have the nodeid used for the old write enabler embedded in it,
        in the following string::

         The write enabler was recorded by nodeid '%s'.

        Note that the nodeid here is encoded using the same base32 encoding
        used by Foolscap and allmydata.util.idlib.nodeid_b2a().

class IMutableFileNode(IFileNode, IMutableFilesystemNode):
    """I provide access to a 'mutable file', which retains its identity
    regardless of what contents are put in it.

    The consistency-vs-availability problem means that there might be
    multiple versions of a file present in the grid, some of which might be
    unrecoverable (i.e. have fewer than 'k' shares). These versions are
    loosely ordered: each has a sequence number and a hash, and any version
    with seqnum=N was uploaded by a node which has seen at least one version
    with seqnum=N-1.

    The 'servermap' (an instance of IMutableFileServerMap) is used to
    describe the versions that are known to be present in the grid, and which
    servers are hosting their shares. It is used to represent the 'state of
    the world', and is used for this purpose by my test-and-set operations.
    Downloading the contents of the mutable file will also return a
    servermap. Uploading a new version into the mutable file requires a
    servermap as input, and the semantics of the replace operation is
    'replace the file with my new version if it looks like nobody else has
    changed the file since my previous download'. Because the file is
    distributed, this is not a perfect test-and-set operation, but it will do
    its best. If the replace process sees evidence of a simultaneous write,
    it will signal an UncoordinatedWriteError, so that the caller can take
    corrective action.


    Most readers will want to use the 'best' current version of the file, and
    should use my 'download_best_version()' method.

    To unconditionally replace the file, callers should use overwrite(). This
    is the mode that user-visible mutable files will probably use.

    To apply some delta to the file, call modify() with a callable modifier
    function that can apply the modification that you want to make. This is
    the mode that dirnodes will use, since most directory modification
    operations can be expressed in terms of deltas to the directory state.


    Three methods are available for users who need to perform more complex
    operations. The first is get_servermap(), which returns an up-to-date
    servermap using a specified mode. The second is download_version(), which
    downloads a specific version (not necessarily the 'best' one). The third
    is 'upload', which accepts new contents and a servermap (which must have
    been updated with MODE_WRITE). The upload method will attempt to apply
    the new contents as long as no other node has modified the file since the
    servermap was updated. This might be useful to a caller who wants to
    merge multiple versions into a single new one.

    Note that each time the servermap is updated, a specific 'mode' is used,
    which determines how many peers are queried. To use a servermap for my
    replace() method, that servermap must have been updated in MODE_WRITE.
    These modes are defined in allmydata.mutable.common, and consist of
    MODE_READ, MODE_WRITE, MODE_ANYTHING, and MODE_CHECK. Please look in
    allmydata/mutable/servermap.py for details about the differences.

    Mutable files are currently limited in size (about 3.5MB max) and can
    only be retrieved and updated all-at-once, as a single big string. Future

        original data. This operation is invoked by calling encode(). Once
        the encoding parameters are set up, the encode operation can be

        set_params() prepares the encoder to accept blocks of input data that

        all, whereas set_params(1000, 1, 10) provides 10x redundancy.

        Numerical Restrictions: 'data_size' is required to be an integral

        smaller memory footprint).

        This will return a Deferred that will fire with two lists. The first
        is a list of shares, each of which is a string (or other buffer
        object) such that len(share) is the same as what get_share_size()
        returned earlier. The second is a list of shareids, in which each is
        an integer. The lengths of the two lists will always be equal to each
        other. The user should take care to keep each share closely
        associated with its shareid, as one is useless without the other.

        The length of this output list will normally be the same as the value
        provided to the 'max_shares' parameter of set_params(). This may be
        different if 'desired_share_ids' is provided.

        'desired_share_ids', if provided, is required to be a sequence of
        ints, each of which is required to be >= 0 and < max_shares. If not
        provided, encode() will produce 'max_shares' shares, as if
        'desired_share_ids' were set to range(max_shares). You might use this
        if you initially thought you were going to use 10 peers, started
        encoding, and then two of the peers dropped out: you could use
        desired_share_ids= to skip the work (both memory and CPU) of
        producing shares for the peers which are no longer available.

        """

    def encode(inshares, desired_share_ids=None):
        """Encode some data. This may be called multiple times. Each call is
        independent.

        inshares is a sequence of length required_shares, containing buffers
        (i.e. strings), where each buffer contains the next contiguous
        non-overlapping segment of the input data. Each buffer is required to
        be the same length, and the sum of the lengths of the buffers is
        required to be exactly the data_size promised by set_params(). (This
        implies that the data has to be padded before being passed to
        encode(), unless of course it already happens to be an even multiple
        of required_shares in length.)

         ALSO: the requirement to break up your data into 'required_shares'
         chunks before calling encode() feels a bit surprising, at least from
         the point of view of a user who doesn't know how FEC works. It feels
         like an implementation detail that has leaked outside the
         abstraction barrier. Can you imagine a use case in which the data to
         be encoded might already be available in pre-segmented chunks, such
         that it is faster or less work to make encode() take a list rather
         than splitting a single string?

         ALSO ALSO: I think 'inshares' is a misleading term, since encode()
         is supposed to *produce* shares, so what it *accepts* should be
         something other than shares. Other places in this interface use the
         word 'data' for that-which-is-not-shares.. maybe we should use that
         term?

        'desired_share_ids', if provided, is required to be a sequence of
        ints, each of which is required to be >= 0 and < max_shares. If not
        provided, encode() will produce 'max_shares' shares, as if
        'desired_share_ids' were set to range(max_shares). You might use this
        if you initially thought you were going to use 10 peers, started
        encoding, and then two of the peers dropped out: you could use
        desired_share_ids= to skip the work (both memory and CPU) of
        producing shares for the peers which are no longer available.

        For each call, encode() will return a Deferred that fires with two
        lists, one containing shares and the other containing the shareids.
        The get_share_size() method can be used to determine the length of
        the share strings returned by encode(). Each shareid is a small
        integer, exactly as passed into 'desired_share_ids' (or
        range(max_shares), if desired_share_ids was not provided).

        The shares and their corresponding shareids are required to be kept
        together during storage and retrieval. Specifically, the share data is
        useless by itself: the decoder needs to be told which share is which
        by providing it with both the shareid and the actual share data.

        This function will allocate an amount of memory roughly equal to::

         (max_shares - required_shares) * get_share_size()

        When combined with the memory that the caller must allocate to
        provide the input data, this leads to a memory footprint roughly
        equal to the size of the resulting encoded shares (i.e. the expansion
        factor times the size of the input segment).

        The monitor will be checked periodically to see if the operation has

        If verify=False, a relatively lightweight check will be performed: I
        will ask all servers if they have a share for me, and I will believe
        whatever they say. If there are at least N distinct shares on the
