def servers_of_happiness(sharemap):
    """
    I accept 'sharemap', a dict of shareid -> set(peerid) mappings. I
    return the 'servers_of_happiness' number that sharemap results in.

    To calculate the 'servers_of_happiness' number for the sharemap, I
    construct a bipartite graph with servers in one partition of vertices
    and shares in the other, and with an edge between a server s and a share t
    if s is to store t. I then compute the size of a maximum matching in
    the resulting graph; this is then returned as the 'servers_of_happiness'
    for my arguments.

    For example, consider the following layout:

      server 1: shares 1, 2, 3, 4
      server 2: share 6
      server 3: share 3
      server 4: share 4
      server 5: share 2

    From this, we can construct the following graph:

      L = {server 1, server 2, server 3, server 4, server 5}
      R = {share 1, share 2, share 3, share 4, share 6}
      V = L U R
      E = {(server 1, share 1), (server 1, share 2), (server 1, share 3),
           (server 1, share 4), (server 2, share 6), (server 3, share 3),
           (server 4, share 4), (server 5, share 2)}
      G = (V, E)

    Note that G is bipartite since every edge in e has one endpoint in L
    and one endpoint in R.

    A matching in a graph G is a subset M of E such that, for any vertex
    v in V, v is incident to at most one edge of M. A maximum matching
    in G is a matching that is no smaller than any other matching. For
    this graph, a matching of cardinality 5 is:

      M = {(server 1, share 1), (server 2, share 6),
           (server 3, share 3), (server 4, share 4),
           (server 5, share 2)}

    Since G is bipartite, and since |L| = 5, we cannot have an M' such
    that |M'| > |M|. Then M is a maximum matching in G. Intuitively, and
    as long as k <= 5, we can see that the layout above has
    servers_of_happiness = 5, which matches the results here.
