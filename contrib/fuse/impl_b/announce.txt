Hi all,

I implemented for fun another Tahoe-to-FUSE interface using my own set
of FUSE bindings.  If you are interested, you can check out the
following subversion directory:

    http://codespeak.net/svn/user/arigo/hack/pyfuse

tahoe.py is a 100-lines, half-an-hour-job interface to Tahoe, limited to
read-only at the moment.  The rest of the directory contains PyFuse, and
many other small usage examples.  PyFuse is a pure Python FUSE daemon
(no messy linking issues, no dependencies).


A bientot,

Armin Rigo
