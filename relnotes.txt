ANNOUNCING: Allmydata-Tahoe version 0.7

We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.7 of allmydata.org
"Tahoe".

Tahoe is a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant filesystem.  All of
the source code is available under a Free Software, Open Source
licence (or two).

This filesystem is encrypted and distributed over multiple peers in
such a way that it continues to work correctlly even when some of the
peers are unavailable, malfunctioning, or malicious.

This is the successor to Allmydata-Tahoe v0.6.1, which was released
October 15, 2007 [1].

This release adds decentralized, encrypted directories and mutable
files, making it the first release of Tahoe in which no part of the
filesystem is centralized.  It also adds a FUSE interface, allowing
you to access a distributed Tahoe grid as if it were a normal local
filesystem.

This is also the first release to be offered under a novel open source
licence which allows people to redistributed proprietary derivatives
of Tahoe for a limited time.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe, you can distribute your filesystem across a set of
computers, such that if some of the computers fail or turn out to be
malicious, the filesystem continues to work from the remaining
computers.  You can also share your files with other users, using a
strongly encrypted, capability-based access control scheme.

This release is targeted at hackers and smart users who are willing to
use a web user interface, a command-line user interface, or a FUSE
interface.  (Or a RESTful API.  Just telnet to localhost and type HTTP
requests to get started.)

Because this software is new, it is not yet recommended for storage of
highly confidential data nor for valuable data which is not otherwise
backed up. However, it works well in practice, it comes with extensive
unit tests, and there are no known security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity.  (For a current
description of all known security issues and an overview of Tahoe's
security properties, please see the Security web page: [2].)

This release of Tahoe is suitable for the "friendnet" use case [3] --
it is easy to create a filesystem spread over the computers of you
and your friends so that you can share files and disk space with one
another.
