ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.8.0

The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 1.8.0 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely
reliable distributed storage system. Get it here:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/quickstart.html

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" — meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/about.html

The current stable release of Tahoe-LAFS is v1.7.1, which was
released July 18, 2010 [1].

v1.8.0 offers greatly improved performance and fault-tolerance
of downloads and improved Windows support. See the NEWS file
[2] for details.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].

We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.

This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.txt file [4].)


COMPATIBILITY

This release is compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.

This is the eleventh release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the forseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.

SPONSORSHIP

Tahoe-LAFS was originally developed by Allmydata, Inc., a
provider of commercial backup services. After discontinuing
funding of Tahoe-LAFS R&D in early 2009, they continued
to provide servers, bandwidth, small personal gifts as tokens
of appreciation, and bug reports.

Google, Inc. sponsored Tahoe-LAFS development as part of the
Google Summer of Code 2010. They awarded four sponsorships to
students from around the world to hack on Tahoe-LAFS that
summer.

Thank you to Allmydata and Google for their generous and
public-spirited support.


HACK TAHOE-LAFS!

If you can find a security flaw in Tahoe-LAFS which is serious
enough that feel compelled to warn our users and issue a fix,
then we will award you with a customized t-shirts with your
exploit printed on it and add you to the "Hack Tahoe-LAFS Hall
Of Fame" [12].


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is the fifth release of Tahoe-LAFS to be created solely
as a labor of love by volunteers. Thank you very much to the
team of "hackers in the public interest" who make Tahoe-LAFS
possible.
