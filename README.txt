===============================

Tahoe-LAFS is a Free Software/Open Source decentralized data store. It
distributes your filesystem across multiple servers, and even if some of the
servers fail or are taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues
to work correctly and to preserve your privacy and security.

To get started please see `quickstart.html`_.
