Welcome to the Tahoe-LAFS project--a secure, decentralized,
fault-tolerant filesystem.  All of the source code is available under
a Free Software, Open Source licence (or two).

To get started please read

 * docs/install.html
 * docs/about.html
 * docs/running.html

Finally, see docs/known_issues.txt for things that you need to know
about if you are relying on Tahoe to store your valuable data.
