Welcome to the Tahoe project [1], a secure, decentralized,
fault-tolerant filesystem.  All of the source code is available under
a Free Software, Open Source licence (or two).

Please see docs/about.html for an introduction, docs/install.html for
install instructions, docs/running.html for usage instructions.

Finally, see docs/known_issues.txt for things that you need to know
about if you are relying on Tahoe to store your valuable data.
