Welcome to the Tahoe project, a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant
filesystem.  All of the source code is available under a Free
Software, Open Source licence.

This filesystem is encrypted and spread over multiple peers in such a
way that it remains available even when some of the peers are
unavailable, malfunctioning, or malicious.
