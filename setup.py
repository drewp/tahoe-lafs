def add_tahoe_paths():
    """Modify sys.path and PYTHONPATH to include Tahoe and supporting libraries

    The first step towards building Tahoe is to run::

      python setup.py build_tahoe

    which is the equivalent of::

      mkdir -p $(BASEDIR)/support/lib/python2.5/site-packages
       (or cygpath equivalent)
      setup.py develop --prefix=$(BASEDIR)/support

    This installs .eggs for any dependent libraries that aren't already
    available on the system, into support/lib/pythonN.N/site-packages (or
    support/Lib/site-packages on windows). It also adds an .egg-link for
    Tahoe itself into the same directory.

    We add this directory to os.environ['PYTHONPATH'], so that any child
    processes we spawn will be able to use these packages.

    When the setuptools site.py sees that supportlib in PYTHONPATH, it scans
    through it for .egg and .egg-link entries, and adds them to sys.path .
    Since python has already processed all the site.py files by the time we
    get here, we perform this same sort of processing ourselves: this makes
    tahoe (and dependency libraries) available to code within setup.py
    itself. This is used by the 'setup.py trial' subcommand, which invokes
    trial directly rather than spawning a subprocess (this is easier than
    locating the 'trial' executable, especially when Twisted was installed as
    a dependent library).

    We'll need to add these .eggs to sys.path before importing anything that
    isn't a part of stdlib. All the directories that we add this way are put
    at the start of sys.path, so they will override anything that was present
    on the system (and perhaps found lacking by the setuptools requirements
    expressed in _auto_deps.py).

    # number of .egg and .egg-link entries there. Add all of them to
    # sys.path, since that what the setuptools site.py would do if it
    # encountered them at process start time. Without this step, the rest of
    # this process would be unable to use the packages installed there. We
    # don't need to add them to PYTHONPATH, since the site.py present there
    # will add them when the child process starts up.
