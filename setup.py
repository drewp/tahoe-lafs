"""Welcome to the Tahoe project, a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant

malfunctioning, or malicious."""

# The darcsver command from the darcsver plugin is needed to initialize the
# distribution's .version attribute correctly. (It does this either by
# examining darcs history, or if that fails by reading the
# src/allmydata/_version.py file). darcsver will also write a new version
# stamp in src/allmydata/_version.py, with a version number derived from
# darcs history. Note that the setup.cfg file has an "[aliases]" section
# which enumerates commands that you might run and specifies that it will run
# darcsver before each one. If you add different commands (or if I forgot
# some that are already in use), you may need to add it to setup.cfg and
# configure it to run darcsver before your command, if you want the version
# number to be correct when that command runs.

# everything will work out until the Nevow issue is fixed:
# http://divmod.org/trac/ticket/2629 setuptools_trial is needed if you want
